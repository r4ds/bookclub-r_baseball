# The Baseball Datasets


**Learning objectives:**

- Bookclub overivew

- Introduction to data sets we will use for the book

## Overview {-}

- Book: [Analyzing Baseball Data with R](https://beanumber.github.io/abdwr3e/)
- Code Repo : [adbwr3edata](https://github.com/beanumber/abdwr3edata)
- Goal: Learn how to answer baseball questions by learning how to:

   - Access baseball data
      
   - Manipulate and analyze baseball data with R and tidyverse.
      
   - Communicate results with quarto and shiny 
      
      
## Baseball terms {-}

Some useful resources for defintions of Baseball terms and statistics:

[MLB Glossary](https://www.mlb.com/glossary)

[Baseball reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/about/)

[MLB Rules 2025](https://mktg.mlbstatic.com/mlb/official-information/2025-official-baseball-rules.pdf)

## Lahman Databse {-}

- Season by Season data from 1871 to current season

- Consists of multiple tables:

   - People : Player names, DOB, etc
   
   - Batting : Batting statistics by player / year / 'stint'
   
   - Pitching : Pitching statistics by player / year / 'stint'
   
   - Fielding : Fielding statistics by player / year / 'stint'
   
   - Teams : Team performance by year.
   
## Lahman from `R` {-}


```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(tidyverse)
Teams |>
  slice_tail(n = 3)
```
## Example Uses for Lahman {-}
 
- Good for answering questions like:
   - What is the average number of home runs per game recorded in each decade? Does the rate of strikeouts show any correlation with the rate of home runs? (*Teams* table)
   
   - How does the percentage of games completed by the starting pitcher from 2000 to 2010 compare to the percentage of games 100 years before? (*Pitching* table)
   
   - Which player had the most walks per plate appearance (BB%) in a given year? (*Batting* table)


## Retrosheet Game-by-Game Data {-}

- Game logs going back to 1871

  - Teams offensive / defensive stats, starting players, etc
  
  - All 161 fields documented [here](https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/glfields.txt). 

- [Retrosheet game logs](https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html) are provided for each season as zipped csv files.

- Some sample data is provided in the books code repo. 

- Example question: In which months are home runs more likely to occur?

## Retrosheet Play-by-Play Data {-}

- Event files provided for each game since 1913

- Data for each play (similar to what you might find on a baseball scoresheet). 

- [Event files](https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm) are provided as zipped collections by season.   One file covers a teams season of games.

- [Detailed description](https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm)

- Example line:
`play,3,1,bichb001,01,CX,D8/L89XD+.1-3` 

Translation: 

>In the 3rd inning, with the visiting team (Blue Jays) at bat, Bo Bichette hit a double to center field. The ball was lined to center and involved both the center and right fielders. Due to a misplay or error, the batter advanced beyond the expected base. Additionally, a runner who was on first base advanced to third base on the play.
 `

## Accessing the data {-}

- Retrosheet provides some (DOS!) tools for parsing the data

- Instead, book recommends using tools presented in Appendix A

- Example Question: What is the Major league batting average when the ball/strike count is 0-2? What about on 2-0?

## Pitch-by-Pitch Data {-}

![PitchLocation](images/pitchlocation.png)

- Even more detailed data: Ball release point, trajectory, location at plate, etc. 

- PITCHf/x data from 2008-2017 (?). Replaced by Statcast

- Example question: What are the chances of a successful steal when the pitcher throws a fastball compared to when a curve is delivered?

## Statcast {-}

- Tracks more than PITCHf/x including movement of the individual players

- Limited data is provided to public by [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com)

- [Baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package provides tools to download Baseball Savant data (and more!)

At the moment, this doesn't seem to be working though with the CRAN version. Need to install the development version:

```
# Install the remotes package if you haven't already
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("BillPetti/baseballr")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(baseballr)
noah <- statcast_search(start_date = "2016-04-06",
                          end_date = "2016-04-15", 
                          playerid = 592789, 
                          player_type = 'pitcher')
```

- Example Question: How frequently do MLB teams employ infield shifts?

## Other data on baseballr {-}

- Scrape extensive data frorm [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com)  and [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com)  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(baseballr)
bref_standings_on_date("2025-04-12", "NL East", from = FALSE)
```

- Retrosheet - but needs a special CLI (See Appendix A)

## Data used in the book {-}

- Lahman data from `Lahman` package
- Small examples for other data are in `abdwr3edata` package
- Large examples will require downloading data seperately.

## Exercises {-}

### Exercise 1: {-}

This chapter has given an overview of the Lahman database, the Retrosheet game logs, the Retrosheet play-by-play files, the PITCHf/x database, and the Statcast database. Describe the relevant data among these four databases that can be used to answer the following baseball questions.

How has the rate of walks (per team for nine innings) changed over the history of baseball?
What fraction of baseball games in 1968 were shutouts? Compare this fraction with the fraction of shutouts in the 2012 baseball season.

What percentage of first pitches are strikes? If the count is 2-0, what fraction of the pitches are strikes?

Which players are most likely to hit groundballs? Of these players, compare the speeds at which these groundballs are hit.

Is it easier to steal second base or third base? (Compare the fraction of successful steals of second base with the fraction of successful steals of third base.)
